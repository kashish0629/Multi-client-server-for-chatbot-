**Objective:**
Developed a secure chatbot communication system with end-to-end encryption, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of messages exchanged between multiple clients and the server.
**Features:**
Multi-client support with each client using distinct encryption algorithms:
**Client 1: Polyalphabetic encryption.
Client 2: Playfair encryption.
Client 3: Monoalphabetic encryption.
Client 4: Rail Fence encryption.**
Implementation of end-to-end encryption to secure communication against unauthorized access or interception.
Seamless user experience with a robust, scalable design for secure data transmission.
**Technologies Used:**
**Programming Languages:** Python (socket programming for client-server communication).
**Encryption Algorithms:** Polyalphabetic, Playfair, Monoalphabetic, and Rail Fence ciphers.
**Libraries:** Socket, Numpy, and custom cryptographic logic.
**Key Responsibilities:**
Designed and implemented the server to handle encrypted communications from multiple clients.
Developed custom encryption and decryption algorithms for secure message exchange.
Conducted rigorous testing to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of transmitted data.
